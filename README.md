# SassScss

This project demonstrates how to use SASS/SCSS to customise angular components. This is part of a series of Angular Workshops I've doing with my team. The goal of the workshops is to improve the team's skills in Angular and Spring, technologies that will be used in the new projects.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
